/**
 * This module provides a class and utilities for multiplexing duplex streams. A
 * multiplexer is not a stream itself, but rather a wrapper around a duplex stream.
 * The multiplexer provides methods for creating "channels" over the underlying stream,
 * which are themselves duplex streams and may have a different message type and
 * validation logic.
 *
 * The multiplexer is constructed in an idle state, and must be explicitly "started"
 * via the `start()` method. Channels are backed up by the same implementation as other
 * duplex streams, and are synchronized in the same way. Consequently, channels can be
 * added at any time before  the multiplexer has ended, without message loss. Attempting
 * to add channels after the multiplexer has ended will throw.
 *
 * While channels can be added in arbitrary order, the multiplexer and its channels end
 * jointly or not at all. This is to say, if the underlying duplex stream or a channel
 * ends, all streams associated with the multiplexer will end.
 *
 * @module StreamMultiplexer
